          <p className='body'>
            As a company, and as individuals working at CivicActions, we license
            all work products (including code, text, and other creative
            expressions) under public license.
          </p>
          <p className='body'>
            Our practical intention with this policy is to remove legal barriers
            that would keep organizations and individuals from rapidly deploying
            works that are critical to achieving their mission.
          </p>
          <p className='body'>
            As our default position, we obtain all materials under a public
            license from our contractors and clients, and we provide works to
            others under the same licenses.

            In practice, this policy supports the culture and values of
            CivicActions by allowing us to:

          <ul>
            <li className='body'>
              Stay focused on the work of helping clients accomplish their

            </li>
            <li className='body'>
              Attract clients that hold similar values and wish to empower their
              own communities through public and open source licensing
            </li>
            <li className='body'>
              Attract creative, technical, and strategic talent by allowing them
              to maintain access to their creations forever
            </li>
            <li className='body'>
              Position ourselves so that we are paid for being present, not for
              work that was done in the past
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className='body'>
            Our free and open licensing policies help our company grow and
            thrive, while empowering others to do the same.
