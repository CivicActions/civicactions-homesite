He appreciates the ever-changing nature of technology and enjoys solving tricky problems.\n\nDaniel has an M.F.A. in Art from the University of Arizona, and has been a leader in his creative community for over 15 years. His curiosity and civic-minded ethos have led him to establish an art center, start his own Drupal shop, open an art gallery, organize Drupal events, and bind a book for the pope. He’s currently learning to play the mandocello.\n\n\n\n### Things Daniel has been doing\n* Helping Veterans [access health care](https://civicactions.com/case-study/va-cms-modernization) and benefits online through a modernized platform\n* Maintaining [a Drupal module](https://github.com/schiavo/digitalgovsearch) that helps the public search government sites\n* Organizing a convening of Drupal-enthusiasts in [Baltimore](https://www.bmoredrupal.com/)\n* [Talking](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/medium-massage-20) about how to “speak the language of the web”\n* Helping lead [an organization](http://drupal4gov.us/) to support the Drupal community in government\n* Making [paintings](https://www.schiavo.net/) and exhibiting [contemporary art](https://www.facebook.com/thelodgegallery/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAOZNIBAvc7Dzko1BjWlRZmoR4my2XsP8I7S-uD9-I-GYWsWHl5NbUAy8L8tve_m5sSvrALgZ21TaUU&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__[0]=68.ARA9ynJQeEx1b0NjU485UJbHq4x7NkesEZOLXVBbQFywLUI6AxZSkUd-yZBobiCjfdYME18AsRjbw0fV97m1b7oBpmQCSLbMcnxUAaNk0RDUEK2dZ8n5tzgZG0uzBj0aLTy_4B06nPnLtowh0bA25JcNzDbIfCUlgYBg9qMLX95Mg_nFwsXB2BzPexJ_ZOn_srQF124ije81uixz7ASy3b7wNUYdPxZuxLzyK4gUY6AHa4cHxEMpdb2Hy6sFcwGXT40lJNbUDETlFqH4lw4y41H75An9G9Mimg4TxxhE-sptVsPBrFKLACoL2yCplYMPKsekpcvjg9e74tVbhhc2tJw)\n* Strumming along in the [Baltimore Mandolin Orchestra](http://www.baltimoremandolinorchestra.org/index.php)&quot;

Melinda is also a community and culture advocate, so you can often find her mentoring and supporting her teammates, connecting people to good ideas and to each other.\n\nMelinda seeks variety and diversity in all things. After a few years of “digital nomadism,” wandering the western United States in a Eurovan with her partner and three kids, she’s now happy to be found typing away on a porch somewhere in Oklahoma, hopefully watching a thunderstorm and petting a cat.\n\n\n### Things Melinda has been doing\n* Helping government agencies build [effective distributed teams](https://distributedgov.com/)\n* Contributing to a content strategy that helps Veterans [access health care](https://civicactions.com/case-study/va-cms-modernization) and benefits online\n* [Demonstrating the impact](https://civicactions.com/case-study) of the work we do\n* Building a network to support and connect [government innovators](https://www.agilegovleaders.org/)\n* Planning [magical annual gatherings](https://medium.com/civicactions/how-our-distributed-team-makes-up-for-a-year-apart-c68503192d26) for our distributed team\n* Keeping [people at the center](https://medium.com/agile-government-leadership/building-a-human-centered-ecosystem-for-government-innovation-78caa014fdb0) of government modernization\n* Remodeling an Airstream and [traveling cross-country](https://www.instagram.com/openairfamily/) in a Eurovan\n* [Celebrating](https://medium.com/civicactions/how-remote-working-helps-us-live-our-dreams-and-get-more-work-done-1af24b27467) the joys of remote work and advocating for [parents who work from home](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NowRTl82uHlnhvQoRL7zw9E0Rhhh8xen3jd9M_E5u30/edit#slide=id.gb3711abec_1_2)&quot;
