Daily collaboration among all team members, from Design to DevOps to Developers, allowed us to quickly test and iterate on every step. \n\nWe used Drupal as our preferred open source platform and the CMS design system, which builds on the U.S. Web Design System. Together, these tools provide a solid foundation for accessible government websites — a key goal for agencies like CMS that serve diverse and aging populations.\n\nHuman Centered Design played a critical role in our process of building a site that would be intuitive and useful to older Americans seeking information about their drug coverage options.","Image":[],"Title":"Our Approach"},{"Text":"We talked to real Medicare beneficiaries to understand the challenges they faced in navigating the site.

Planning a large-scale web and content management project to improve the customer experience of their multiple websites, the agency launched a design challenge for the vendors that were finalists for the contract.\n\nWe did a fast-paced collaboration with our partners Fearless and KPMG to submit deliverables in just 8 business days (including page designs, content recommendations, an API, and a clickable prototype with a smart chatbot). Our team won the challenge because the agency saw we could help them achieve their goal to better serve Medicare beneficiaries.\n","Client_Goal":"The task was to redesign the Medicare Part D section of the medicare.gov website, which helps people understand insurance options for their medication needs. For all their digital platforms, CMS needs to:\n- Meet public expectation for easily navigable online services\n- Securely manage personal info and transactions for millions of beneficiaries\n- Provide friendly online experience for people facing stressful health situations\n- Serve diverse groups of users with competing wants and priorities\n- Support agency staff in publishing clear and accurate public-facing content"},"Client_Name":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services","Path":"/case-study/human-center-design","Expertise":[{"Expertise_Content":"- Agile Methodologies\n- User Research\n- Heuristic Evaluation\n- Persona & Scenario Design\n- Information Architecture\n- Content Strategy\n- Workflow & Interaction Design\n- Prototype Development & Testing\n- Visual Design\n- Mobile Optimization\n- API Design & Deployment"}],"Hero_Image":[{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/ca-it-prod-home-5918-strapi/production/WECMS_DESIGN_hero_8d8f9a3b45/WECMS_DESIGN_hero_8d8f9a3b45.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":""}],"Key_Outcome":[{"Text":"Because we spoke to Medicare recipients and validated our proposed solutions with them, CMS knows that real user needs will be met with the redesigned site, helping people access benefits more easily.","Title":"Research-based solution"},{"Text":"Medicare.gov visitors deserve a consistent experience across all parts of the site, on any device.
