Daily collaboration among all team members, from Design to DevOps to Developers, allowed us to quickly test and iterate on every step. \n\nWe used [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/industries/government) as our preferred open source platform and the [CMS design system](https://design.cms.gov/), which builds on the U.S. Web Design System. Together, these tools provide a solid foundation for [accessible government websites](https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281) — a key goal for agencies like CMS that serve diverse and aging populations.\n\nHuman Centered Design played a critical role in our process of building a site that would be intuitive and useful to older Americans seeking information about their drug coverage options.","Image":{"url":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null},"Title":"Our approach"},{"Text":"We talked to real Medicare beneficiaries to understand the challenges they faced in navigating the site. Based on what they said, we created a [key persona](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19f_pUBSrIRxDJdnvNa4uROiP_QwQKWoh/view?usp=sharing) to drive our scenario-based approach —  ensuring that our work solved real problems and created value for users.

This was done through intuitive navigation and labels, scannable and actionable content, and a refreshed, accessible design.

Planning a large-scale web and content management project to improve the customer experience of their multiple websites, the agency launched a design challenge for the vendors that were finalists for the contract. \n\nWe did a fast-paced collaboration with our partners [Fearless](https://fearless.tech/) and [KPMG](https://www.kpmg.us/) to submit deliverables in just 8 business days (including page designs, content recommendations, an API, and a clickable prototype with a smart chatbot). Our team won the challenge because the agency saw we could help them achieve their goal to better serve Medicare beneficiaries.","Client_Goal":"The task was to redesign the [Medicare Part D](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d) section of the medicare.gov website, which helps people understand insurance options for their medication needs.
