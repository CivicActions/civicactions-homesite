Specifically, Drupal supports compliance with the newly-updated Section 508, a law requiring federal agencies to make their information and communication technology (ICT) accessible to people of varying abilities. \n\n“People tend to think of web accessibility as a checklist — but the web is now evolving so quickly that today’s checklist could be outdated next year,” said OpenConcept founder Mike Gifford, who will now serve as a Senior Strategist at CivicActions, advising on and identifying opportunities for improving accessibility compliance in government. \n\n “Web accessibility must be part of the foundational design, and CivicActions is emerging as a leader in this space,” Gifford said. “My team and I are thrilled to further amplify that work and help government agencies raise the bar in building simple, inclusive services for citizens.” \n\nVisit the company blog to read more about how CivicActions is [improving government accessibility through open source](https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281).
