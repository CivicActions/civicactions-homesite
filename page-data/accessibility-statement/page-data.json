Learn how we approach accessibility on our website.","Body":"## Serving people of all abilities\nWe are passionate about improving government technology to serve the public better, and that includes people of all backgrounds, situations, and abilities. Similarly, we want our website to also be accessible to as many people as possible. This page explains what we’ve done towards better accessibility and how you can give feedback.\n\n## User experience on our site\nPeople using our website should be able to:\n\n- Zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen\n- Navigate the website using just a keyboard\n- Listen to the website using a screen reader \n\nFor more accessibility practices and guidelines that we encourage everyone to follow (including ourselves), visit our [Accessibility Community of Practice](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/).\n\n## What we've done\nTechniques and tools we have used to make our site more accessible include:\n\n- [Plain-language writing](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-approach/plain-language/) to ensure content is easy to read and understand\n- Testing with VoiceOver and Microsoft’s Edge browser\n- Manual keyboard testing\n- Tools: [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/), Axe\n- Choosing a color palette based on the [U.S. Web Design System’s color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/) so we could leverage the [magic number](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/overview/#magic-number)to ensure it is easy to have sufficient contrast\n\n## Future goals\nWe know there is more that we can do to make our website more accessible. This is a work in progress. Our goal is to achieve or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA, recognized globally as the standard best practice.\n\nOur current site does not support:\n\n- Personalization of line height or fonts\n- Common high contrast settings for low vision users \n- Low contrast mode for dyslexic users\n- Viewing the site in light or dark mode\n- Changing colors, contrast levels, and fonts\n\nWe have also identified that Reader Mode has trouble on some pages. And although PDFs are used sparingly on our site, some do exist. We want to make these accessible, or ensure the content is available in HTML format.\n\nRealizing that accessibility is never “done”, we plan to keep scanning the site and improving it over time. Our plans include:\n\n- Testing the site with speech recognition software\n- Inviting users who are living with disabilities to evaluate our site\n\n## Get in touch\nThe web is constantly changing. We need feedback from our users on how we can improve. If you run into barriers on our site, please let us know.\n\nGive [feedback here](/feedback), or send an email to [accessibility@civicactions.com](mailto:accessibility@civicactions.com)\n\nThis statement was prepared on June 8, 2021. It will be reviewed periodically, and updated as accessibility on our site evolves.\n","Path":"/accessibility-statement","Title":"Accessibility statement","SEO":{"OGTitle":"Accessibility Statement","OGDescription":"We never stop working to make digital products and government services accessible to people of all abilities.
