Daily collaboration among all team members, from Design to DevOps to Developers, allowed us to quickly test and iterate on every step. \n\nWe used [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/industries/government) as our preferred open source platform and the [CMS design system](https://design.cms.gov/), which builds on the U.S. Web Design System. Together, these tools provide a solid foundation for [accessible government websites](https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281) — a key goal for agencies like CMS that serve diverse and aging populations.\n\nHuman Centered Design played a critical role in our process of building a site that would be intuitive and useful to older Americans seeking information about their drug coverage options.","Image":null,"Title":"Our approach"},{"Text":"We talked to real Medicare beneficiaries to understand the challenges they faced in navigating the site.
