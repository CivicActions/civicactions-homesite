By implementing a modern Drupal CMS and Agile practices, we helped the FCC modernize its approach to content while avoiding disruptions for users and maintaining a secure environment. ","Image":null,"Title":"Our approach"},{"Text":"FCC has a very active user community, so we had to move quickly and avoid disruptions. We performed a massive content migration from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 and consolidated content from various legacy systems into one CMS. To make the content creation and editing more pleasant and efficient, we added a robust text editor and new access controls. This allowed FCC’s many content creators to manage their own content without compromising the integrity of the site’s design.","Image":{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/ca-it-prod-home-5918-strapi/production/FCC_1_2a1f2981d3/FCC_1_2a1f2981d3.jpg","alternativeText":"Person using a laptop to access the redesigned FCC.gov.","caption":"The modernized FCC.gov is clean, simple, and easy to use for visitors and agency staff."},"Title":"Seamless content migration and management"},{"Text":"The FCC is responsible for the accessibility of 21st Century communications, so there was no room for accessibility errors on its website.

We used Behat—a behavior-driven development testing framework that can double as user acceptance test criteria—to make sure all new code worked properly. We configured Behat tests to run automatically whenever new code was merged, ensuring a quality codebase for years to come.","Image":null,"Title":"Automatic testing for quality code"},{"Text":"The content editors at FCC  were drowning in waterfall processes that didn’t let them respond quickly to evolving needs at the agency. To ease content management and improve the employee experience, we worked with key stakeholders to implement Agile practices.
