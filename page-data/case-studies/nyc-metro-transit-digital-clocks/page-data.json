Drupal 8 was a natural choice for the CMS because it can seamlessly integrate data from all these sources. \n\nThen we connected over 3,000 MTA digital screens as unique devices on a private and secure “Internet of Things” within Amazon Web Services — allowing Drupal to push location-specific data to each individual screen. Read a [technical deep-dive on this work](https://dev.acquia.com/blog/using-drupal-8-and-aws-iot-to-power-digital-signage-for-new-yorks-subway-system/01/10/2018/20051) from our partner.","Image":null,"Title":"Our approach"},{"Text":"The MTA needed to display data reliably regardless of the device or front-end design. We created a custom decoupled (headless) Drupal theme built in React.js to adapt to different screen sizes and mobile platforms. The decoupled backend continually evaluates and pushes data from a variety of web service APIs, while compensating for incomplete or outdated information, so users only see data that’s relevant to them.\n","Image":{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/ca-it-prod-home-5918-strapi/production/MTA_1_5da100cebc/MTA_1_5da100cebc.jpg","alternativeText":"A man in a suit stands outside the entrance to the 5th Avenue Bryant Park Metro station in New York City, holding a closed laptop at his side and in his left hand, while he browses his smartphone with his right hand.

The data universe is complex and constantly changing, representing a massive network of trains, tracks, and stations — which need to display reliably and in real time to keep riders informed. \nAcquia and CivicActions worked with MTA to extend the agency’s existing Drupal content management system (CMS) to a network of devices using Amazon’s Internet of Things (IoT). We helped MTA set the modern standard for using digital signage to communicate train arrival times, weather info, and service updates — making it easier for riders to plan their routes and get there on time. \n","Client_Goal":"Riders rely on station signs and the MTA’s website for travel information to help them know when their train will arrive. To better inform riders in real time, MTA needed a way to display information from their website on digital signs in subway stations and platforms. \n\n- Improve travel experience for subway riders by providing  up-to-date info\n- Empower MTA administrators to easily manage data on a familiar platform\n- Provide real time data to help modernize public transportation\n- Implement a flexible system to accommodate future growth\n"},"Client_Name":"New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority","Path":"/case-studies/nyc-metro-transit-digital-clocks","Expertise":[{"Expertise_Content":"- Technical Leadership Consulting\n- Technical Architecture Development\n- User Research\n- Design Thinking and Application\n- Interface Design\n- Backend Development Expertise\n- Design Implementation\n- Content Modeling\n- Responsive Design\n"}],"Hero_Image":null,"Key_Outcome":[{"Text":"With over 3,000 unique digital signs connected to AWS Internet of Things, MTA helps customers see data that is timely and specific to their location and needs.","Title":" Timely digital data"},{"Text":"We developed a Drupal 8 content model to support the MTA’s administrative dashboard so even non-technical users can make changes themselves.","Title":"Easy administration"},{"Text":"Using [React](https://reactjs.org/) allowed us to interpret incoming data, implement appropriate templates, and display relevant information throughout the system — no matter the screen or interface.","Title":"React-ing in real time"},{"Text":"The resilient “headless” approach allows MTA staff to use standard publishing workflows to manage data independently of the screens that are visible to end users.","Title":"Simple workflows"},{"Text":"A few seconds can make a big difference when navigating the world’s largest subway network.
