He seeks opportunities to make the world and its systems more transparent, just, and joyful through good design, collaboration, and communication. \n\nA public policy professional by trade, Ben stumbled into digital product design in 2014. After working on health care, wearable technology, video games, and banking, he is ecstatic to be part of the UX team at CivicActions solving complex problems to help governments serve people better. \n\nBen has a B.A. in Government and a Master of Public Affairs from the University of Texas. A proud Austin native, he spends his free time volunteering, enjoying the sunshine, and patronizing the closest taco stand.
