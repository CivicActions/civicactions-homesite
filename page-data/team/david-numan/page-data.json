His sense of humor and thoughtful technical approach make him a natural mentor for his fellow engineers, and he runs a helpdesk to improve sandbox health, tools, and documentation for developers.\n\nDave has a B.A. in Business and is a PHP Certified Engineer, but he also has plenty of analog hobbies. When not in front of the computer, he roasts fair trade coffee, makes yogurt, and not-so-secretly enjoys watching classic Star Trek episodes. He’s also been known to post Dr. Seuss-esque poetry to enhance conversations in Slack.\n\n\n\n\n### Things David has been doing\n* [Helping the DSCA](https://civicactions.com/case-study/globalnet) create advanced site infrastructure\n* Ensuring [science research](https://nsf.gov/) can be published bug-free through automated QA\n* [Presenting](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-toronto/program/david-numan/) on DevOps and automation in Toronto\n* Leading efforts to improve development tools with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n* Supporting healthy [sandbox setups](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05-engineering/systems-sandboxes/) for development teams\n* Ditching his car for a 30’ sailboat"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/david-numan"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
