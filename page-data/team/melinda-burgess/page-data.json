Melinda is also a community and culture advocate, so you can often find her mentoring and supporting her teammates, connecting people to good ideas and to each other.\n\nMelinda seeks variety and diversity in all things. After a few years of “digital nomadism,” wandering the western United States in a Eurovan with her partner and three kids, she’s now happy to be found typing away on a porch somewhere in Oklahoma, hopefully watching a thunderstorm and petting a cat.\n\n\n### Things Melinda has been doing\n* Helping government agencies build [effective distributed teams](https://distributedgov.com/)\n* Contributing to a content strategy that helps Veterans [access health care](https://civicactions.com/case-study/va-cms-modernization) and benefits online\n* [Demonstrating the impact](https://civicactions.com/case-study) of the work we do\n* Building a network to support and connect [government innovators](https://www.agilegovleaders.org/)\n* Planning [magical annual gatherings](https://medium.com/civicactions/how-our-distributed-team-makes-up-for-a-year-apart-c68503192d26) for our distributed team\n* Keeping [people at the center](https://medium.com/agile-government-leadership/building-a-human-centered-ecosystem-for-government-innovation-78caa014fdb0) of government modernization\n* Remodeling an Airstream and [traveling cross-country](https://www.instagram.com/openairfamily/) in a Eurovan\n* [Celebrating](https://medium.com/civicactions/how-remote-working-helps-us-live-our-dreams-and-get-more-work-done-1af24b27467) the joys of remote work and advocating for [parents who work from home](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NowRTl82uHlnhvQoRL7zw9E0Rhhh8xen3jd9M_E5u30/edit#slide=id.gb3711abec_1_2)"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/melinda-burgess"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
