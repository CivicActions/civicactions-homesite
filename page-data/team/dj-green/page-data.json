DJ often starts with sketches on paper, relishing the early stages of the design process where ideas begin to bloom. You might not hear much from DJ at first — he’s a deep listener, and pays close attention to the nuances in a project that others may have missed. He is a natural helper who enjoys government projects because he can work closely with the people his designs serve. \n\nDJ has a B.F.A. in Interactive Media and Design from the University of the Incarnate Word. He loves drawing, and is fascinated by the patent sketches inventors create to demonstrate their ideas. Outside of work, DJ invests in all sorts of other creative projects — taking photographs, building his own furniture, collecting fly custom sneakers, and raising two daughters.  \n\n\n\n\n### Things DJ has been doing\n* Helping the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) put users first\n* Helping military service members and their families [get the most out of their auto insurance](https://www.usaa.com/)\n* [Teaching aspiring designers](https://www.uiw.edu/index.html) the fundamentals of visual art\n* Promoting services that [strengthen military families and communities](https://www.jbsa.mil/Resources/Military-Family-Readiness/) "}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/dj-green"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
