His early training in painting taught him to start with the general and work towards the specific, an approach that helps him maintain perspective while building and testing the back-end architecture of complex projects. He appreciates the ever-changing nature of technology and enjoys solving tricky problems.\n\nDaniel has an M.F.A. in Art from the University of Arizona, and has been a leader in his creative community for over 15 years. His curiosity and civic-minded ethos have led him to establish an art center, start his own Drupal shop, open an art gallery, organize Drupal events, and bind a book for the pope. He’s currently learning to play the mandocello.\n\n\n\n### Things Daniel has been doing\n* Helping Veterans [access health care](https://civicactions.com/case-study/va-cms-modernization) and benefits online through a modernized platform\n* Maintaining [a Drupal module](https://github.com/schiavo/digitalgovsearch) that helps the public search government sites\n* Organizing a convening of Drupal-enthusiasts in [Baltimore](https://www.bmoredrupal.com/)\n* [Talking](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/medium-massage-20) about how to “speak the language of the web”\n* Helping lead [an organization](http://drupal4gov.us/) to support the Drupal community in government\n* Making [paintings](https://www.schiavo.net/) and exhibiting [contemporary art](https://www.facebook.com/thelodgegallery/?__tn__=K-R&eid=ARAOZNIBAvc7Dzko1BjWlRZmoR4my2XsP8I7S-uD9-I-GYWsWHl5NbUAy8L8tve_m5sSvrALgZ21TaUU&fref=mentions&__xts__[0]=68.ARA9ynJQeEx1b0NjU485UJbHq4x7NkesEZOLXVBbQFywLUI6AxZSkUd-yZBobiCjfdYME18AsRjbw0fV97m1b7oBpmQCSLbMcnxUAaNk0RDUEK2dZ8n5tzgZG0uzBj0aLTy_4B06nPnLtowh0bA25JcNzDbIfCUlgYBg9qMLX95Mg_nFwsXB2BzPexJ_ZOn_srQF124ije81uixz7ASy3b7wNUYdPxZuxLzyK4gUY6AHa4cHxEMpdb2Hy6sFcwGXT40lJNbUDETlFqH4lw4y41H75An9G9Mimg4TxxhE-sptVsPBrFKLACoL2yCplYMPKsekpcvjg9e74tVbhhc2tJw)\n* Strumming along in the [Baltimore Mandolin Orchestra](http://www.baltimoremandolinorchestra.org/index.php)"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/daniel-schiavone"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
