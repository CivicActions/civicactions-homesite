Now Sam applies his boundless energy and wide-ranging technical experience to helping our government clients build Drupal-powered sites optimized for performance. \n\nSam has a B.S. in Electronic Media, Arts, and Communication from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and is an Acquia certified Drupal 8 developer. He’s fascinated by synaesthetic experiences, and takes a multisensory approach to pursuing his many concurrent interests. Right now he’s thinking about pushing the limits of the web as a publishing platform, creating works of multisensory theater, raising emus, the future of web VR, and the chemistry of baking bread.  \n\n\n\n\n### Things Sam has been doing\n* Supporting [Doctors Without Borders’](https://civicactions.com/case-study/msf) new site to raise support to deliver global aid\n* Helping shape technical direction for [a leading open source software firm](https://www.acquia.com/)\n* Shepherding [Amnesty International’s website](https://www.amnesty.org/en/) through a Drupal migration\n* [Explaining](https://github.com/synterra/addictioncode) how pseudocode can help us understand the psychology of addiction \n* Creating multimedia [works of phosphorescent swamp rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKgkj4DF3ns)"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/sam-lerner"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
