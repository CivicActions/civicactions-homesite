Before arriving at CivicActions, he provided technology leadership for numerous nonprofits and led a tech support department at Idealist.org. He is committed to building a better world by making technology more civic-minded and human-friendly.\n\nEro has a B.A. in Literature and Writing with a minor in Teaching from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and his undergraduate study of avant-garde poetry has helped make him expert at writing easy-to-understand technical emails. He is generally believed to be the kindest person who works at CivicActions (that’s saying a lot), and is among the most likely to be covered with cat hair.\n\n\n\n### Things Ero has been doing\n* Helping organizations manage and publish [open data](https://getdkan.org/about/) websites.\n* Providing friendly support to open data teams at [U.S. Health and Human Services](https://www.healthdata.gov/), [U.S. Dept. of Veterans’ Affairs](https://www.data.va.gov/), [State of California](https://data.ca.gov/), and [State of Georgia](https://data.georgia.gov/)\n* Empowering [adult education practitioners](https://lincs.ed.gov/) to learn and collaborate\n* Helping compile  an [open-source handbook](http://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README/) for a passionate team of civic technologists\n* Making peculiar [music](https://erogray.bandcamp.com/) and [art](https://erogray.tumblr.com/)"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/ero-gray"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
