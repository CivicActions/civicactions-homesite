There’s not much Brian doesn’t enjoy doing within the development stack, and he applies his talents to projects that help others.\n\nBrian is a self-taught Drupal whiz, and learns best by diving into something hands-on. When he’s not squashing bugs and messing with code, you can find him working on his beloved Mercury Comet, [a jalopy of a 2-door station wagon.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Osg_-brEzUEjN48yPFmrySKmFCi3TNf) \n\n\n### Things Brian has been doing\n* Helping the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) with large site migrations \n* Helping companies build enterprise software to [conquer digital chaos](https://ashday.com/)\n* Writing about [why it’s time to move to Drupal 8](https://info.ashday.com/blogs/end-of-the-line-for-drupal-7)\n* Teaching friends and co-workers bicycle repair for green, self-sufficient transportation\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/team/brian-seek"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
